The ``YELP`` data can be downloaded [here](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/caf765b062ed49838111/?dl=1) and should be put under ``data/yelp``.

We cannot provide the GYAFC data because copyright issues. You can download the [data](https://github.com/raosudha89/GYAFC-corpus) and the [human references](https://github.com/luofuli/DualRL/tree/master/references/GYAFC), and then preprocess the data following the format as  the YELP data. We use family&relationship domain in all our experiments. The GYAFC data should be put under ``data/GYAFC_family``.
